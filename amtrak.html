    <p>
      <a href="https://amtrak.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amtrak</a> is a train transportation service used in the United States. It has been in operation since 1971 and is still used highly today at 
      roughly 30 million people a year. It is used for those that would like to travel short or medium distances across cities or states. It is more highly sustainable than 
      airlines or automobile, and creates roughly 3.4 billion in revenue.
      <br></br>
      As decent users of Amtrak for the means of transportation, my team of 4 decided to tackle issues we noticed with their website. From the whole website, we decided to 
      focused our efforts on the scheduling and booking information. We first started off with user testing by having the users try to book a ticket. We then condensed our 
      findings and also categorized them by <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Jakob Nielson's 10 usability heuristics</a>. Afterwards, we 
      then identified what components we were redesigning and created 2 prototypes using Figma, one design that reuses existing assets and one that uses new assets.
      <br></br>
      ​This case study was great in helping me learn more about efficient display and structure of information. I learned how one can use drop down functions to make a page have 
      tons of information without cluttering. It allows for a user to traverse 1 less step to reaching their targeted information/page.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>1. Initial User Testing</h3>
        <br />
        <p>To understand how Amtrak was being used by users, we conducted user testing with a scenario regarding booking a ticket. We observed the users as they underwent the 
          tasks and recorded their actions and opinions onto a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16SswBQqRMsECNsMFRDXrucICBfBdzORk/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>User Tasks:</strong></p>
        Scenario: You are going on vacation to Los Angeles from San Diego on November 15th. Your hotel check in time is after 2 pm on that day.
        <ol>
            <li>You want to bring your dog on the train, but you don’t know what the policy is, and what the process entails.</li>
            <li>Without booking a ticket, you want to know when trains depart and arrive.</li>
            <li>Book a one way ticket all the way until payment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>​Observation Plan:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>One person would lead the testing session called the Lead. In the beginning, before the user testing, this person would introduce our goal for doing the test, 
              explain how the testing session is going to work, what the user should do during the session, and ask some initial questions about their knowledge related to travel.</li>
            <li>During the user testing, the lead will give the user three different tasks to finish on Amtrak.com, and remind them (when needed) to think aloud.</li>
            <li>We will record the screen to see the user’s action. Another person will be taking down observation notes called the Observer.</li>
            <li>We will see the screen recording together again. Each group member would come up with 3 most serious problems on the website.</li>
            <li>Debriefing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>2. User Testing Analysis</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          With the results recorded, we organized each users' information by briefly summarizing what went right and wrong, and labelled their top 3 usability errors according 
          to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics</a>.

            <strong>User 1</strong>
            <br />
            <u>What worked:</u>
            <br />
            For this user, figuring out how to book a ticket from San Diego to LA proved to be an easy task as most travel sights operate in the same way.
            <br></br>
            <u>What didn't worked:</u>
            <br />
            Trying to figure out how to find the pet policy was difficult. The user thought that by proceeding to purchase a ticket, there would be an option to add pets, 
            however, there was no indication through the process so he had to backtrack his steps multiple times. The process took roughly 15 minutes to find out any 
            information about pet policies.
            <br></br>
            <u>Top 3 Usability Errors:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>Did not use in-website search bar for any of the goals, opted to find everything manually. (Aesthetic and Minimalist Design) </li>
                <li>Could not find location of pet policies for a decent amount of time due to not understanding how to navigate the website in search of pets. 
                  (Recognize Rather Than Recall)</li>
                <li>Believed that buying a ticket would allow him to add on pets during purchase process (Match between System and the Real World)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>User 2</strong>
            <br />
            <u>What worked:</u>
            <br />
            This user finished the first task (finding the pets’ policy) smoothly by using the search function. She was able to find the schedule of the train, 
            and go through the booking process in general.
            <br></br>
            <u>What didn't worked:</u>
            <br />
            The user was confused when searching for the schedule of the train in specific time interval. She cannot figure out the difference between “noon” and 
            “afternoon”. Although the user checked the pets’ policy, she did not know how to add the ticket for her pet when booking the ticket.
            <br></br>
            <u>Top 3 Usability Errors:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not have an option to add on a pet in the webpage of “Bicycles, Pets, and Golf Clubs”. (Visibility of System Status)</li>
                <li>The schedule of the train has “noon” and “afternoon” being separated into two option while in the booking process it only has “afternoon” option. 
                  (Consistency and Standard)</li>
                <li>When the user filled something wrong (specifically did not fill in the phone number in the correct form), she was sent back to the booking process, 
                  but losing the correctly filled information as well and had to refill the whole table again. (User Control and Freedom)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>User 3</strong>
            <br />
            <u>What worked:</u>
            <br />
            The user navigated around the site pretty smoothly when booking a ticket. She found the time she wanted quickly and knew what to fill out for reserving a ticket.
            <br></br>
            <u>What didn't worked:</u>
            <br />
            The user struggled when she was trying to find out what the pet policies were. She tried clicking on the bicycle add-on function and hoped that there were other 
            tabs that would open. She did not use the search bar to look for hidden information.
            <br></br>
            <u>Top 3 Usability Errors:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>Pets not showing after Bicycle Add-Ons (Visibility of System Status)</li>
                <li>Pet policies have to be searched up somewhere else after reading about Pets Add-On while buying tickets (Recognize Rather Than Recall)</li>
                <li>There are two ways to look up the same train schedules. There is a schedule tab on the top bar and schedules shown while browsing. (Aesthetic and Minimalist Design)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>User 4</strong>
            <br />
            <u>What worked:</u>
            <br />
            Main issue that occurred had to do with the pets situation. The user had an understanding that pets could get onboard, but when she tried to add a pet when booking 
            her ticket, she didn’t know where to add her pet and was confused, so she had to reread the policy and figure out why she couldn’t take her pet.

        <h3>3. Redesign Component 1</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          One component to redesign is the pets indication on the Amtrak website, specifically the consistency in iconography on the booking list, and the indication of pets on 
          the “Add Bicycle, Pets, and Golf Clubs” page. On the booking list, in terms of pets, there are 3 possible indicators: no indicator, a crossed out pet icon, and a pet 
          icon with a number next to it. When traveling from San Diego to Los Angeles, there is no pet icon listed, only bikes. So does that mean pets aren’t allowed? What’s 
          the difference between no icon versus a crossed out icon? On the “Add Bicycle, Pets, and Golf Clubs” page, it is the same case where there are 3 possible indicators. 
          When booking a ticket, there was a lot of confusion as to where to add your pet, and whether they could be let on. There needs to be better consistency and indication 
          as to what is allowed or not.

        <h3>4. Redesign Component 2</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another component to redesign is the booking list due to the fact that during task 2, there were users that used the schedules page, and users who used the booking 
          list. For the users who used the schedules page, they plugged in essentially the same information used for the booking list to look at the train numbers, and 
          their departure and arrival times. They then used that information in the booking list to book a ticket. This ends up being extra steps. For the users who used 
          the booking list, they bypassed the schedules page completely, making it useless. So the idea for the redesign is to combine the schedules and the booking list 
          into one component. More specifically, have the booking list look more condensed like the schedules page that expands into more details of ticket choice, purchasing, 
          and such.

        <h3>5. Redesign 1</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          For redesign 1, we wanted to make a simple version by essentially merging the existing assets from the schedules page and the booking page together. It initially 
          starts as the scheduling page, but has a drop down menu that reveals the booking information in an reorganized way compared to the original. Instead of the price 
          and seat availability being separated, they are together. Instead of the "Add to Cart" button being at the top, which is not very normal in design, it is placed 
          at the bottom where it usually is in typical websites. In addition, for faster usability, filters were added to sort the booking options.

        <h3>6. Redesign 2</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          For redesign 2, we made a complete restyling that would fit perfectly with Amtrak style. Following the same concept of merging the schedules page and booking page, 
          the listings provide more streamline information in the order of bus number, time departure and arrival, total travel time, number of stops, availability of 
          accessibilities, and amount of seats available. This allows for the user to immediately find additional information that they would need in comparison to the 
          original and first redesign. Each listing then has a drop down function which provides more information in regards to seat availability, type, and pricing, with 
          the ability to book the ticket.
